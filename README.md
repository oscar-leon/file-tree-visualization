# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (client or server), you can run:

### `npm install`

Will install all the required packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode: Go to client folder\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Runs the server in the development mode: Go to server folder\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the server.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `CONSIDERATIONS:`

The app is build and designed with an initial scope and closed time requirements. A different approach will apply if we bare in mind escalate or extend the app.

Some things to improve/ToDo:

- Env variables: Currently the app will only work in local and doesn't accept env variables (eg: see the hardcoded connection to the server API).
- Testing
- Some duplicated login on some React components.
- Remove the use of UI library in order to build something cleaner and with less third party code.
- Remove inline style.
